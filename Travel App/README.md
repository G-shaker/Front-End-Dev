# Travel App Capstone Project

## Overview
In this project, a travel application is built that pulls data from multiple APIs. The user is required to enter a city that they plan to travel to along with start and end dates, in return they will receive the weather forecast for their travel dates, a countdown, and a photo of their travel location.

## Installation
From command line:
To build: `npm run build`
To run: `npm run go`

## Notes
Extend option: Add end date and display length of trip.
