# Landing Page Project

In this project, a multi-section landing page is created. The main functionalities include a navigation menu that is dynamically updated when new content is added to the page, showing the section that is currently in the user's view as "active", and smoothly scrolling to different sections when clicking on items from the navigation menu.
