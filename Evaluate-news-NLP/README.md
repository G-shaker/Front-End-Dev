# Project: Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

## Overview

The goal of this project was to get practice in working with Webpack in addition to Webpack Loaders and Plugins, Sass styles, Service workers, Jest, and using APIs and creating requests to external urls.

The webpage is a form that accepts an article url input from the user and then uses the Aylien API to evaluate the article and then shows the response from the API on the webpage.
